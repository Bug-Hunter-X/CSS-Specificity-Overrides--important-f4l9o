The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, we have a parent element with a blue color and a child element with a red color using !important.  However, a more specific selector (.parent .child) sets the color to green. The !important declaration on the .child class is intended to override the .parent rule.  But the higher specificity of `.parent .child` overrides even the `!important` declaration.
