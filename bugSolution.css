The solution involves avoiding the unnecessary use of `!important` and understanding CSS specificity.  In most cases, using a more structured CSS approach will resolve the conflict without needing `!important`.

Here's the corrected version:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

Now, the color of the `.child` element within the `.parent` element is correctly set to green without using `!important`, reflecting proper CSS specificity order.
